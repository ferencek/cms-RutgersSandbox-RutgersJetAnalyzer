### The ParameterSet you want to use
pset = rutgersjetanalyzer_PF2PAT_cfg.py

### To select a single (list of) run within a single processed dataset define run number (list)
### Selection can be a comma-separated list of run numbers and run number ranges: 1,2,3-4
#runselection = 1

### A JSON file that describes which runs and lumis to process. CRAB will skip luminosity blocks not
### listed in the file. When using this setting, you must also use lumi-based splitting rather than
### event based splitting as shown below.
